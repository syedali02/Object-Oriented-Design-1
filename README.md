Pixel.java,Raster.java,ImageDrawerDemo.java are the file which belong to problem 1.
My task was to modify the files Pixel.java and Raster.java.
I was supposed to complete the constructors and write the equals(),toString() and hashCode() methods for both the java files Pixel and Raster.

My task for problem 2 was to create a adapter pattern class and complete all the remaining methods in it.
