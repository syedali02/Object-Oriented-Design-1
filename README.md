Pixel.java,Raster.java,ImageDrawerDemo.java are the file which belong to problem 1.
My task was to modify the files Pixel.java and Raster.java.
I was supposed to complete the constructors and write the equals(),toString() and hashCode() methods for both the java files Pixel and Raster.

All the other files belong to problem 2. 
My task for this problem was to create and adapter pattern class and complete all the remaining methods in it.
